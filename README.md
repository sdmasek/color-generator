<h1>a practice file for randomizing colors in javascript</h1>

I created this as a basic project that most who learn javascript would do well to learn. The prompt based off a FreeCodeCamp tutorial but all code was written by me.

The goal of this project was to create a simple web-based app that generates a random color upon clicking a large centralized button. 
This color is tied to the background so the whole screen changes.

Along with the color changing I placed a <span> within the h1 to display the rgb number - I wanted both the text and the number to be generated by javascript, so the index.html file doesn't have any hard-coded text within the span element.

  CHALLENGES:
  -Learning how javascript works fundamentally: Originally I had placed the code to get the body's background color in a variable. However, this wasn't working, and I noticed when I tested it in the console the number would come up but the background style wouldn't actually change.
  SOLUTIONS:
  -After doing some research I noticed that not once were people using a variable to store the background color. I don't know why javascript favors this but when I got rid of the variable and simply had the function return 'body.style.background' then the app worked perfectly as intended.
